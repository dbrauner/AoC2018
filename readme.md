#Advent of Code 2018

I created this project to solve the challenges of [AoC (Advent of Code)](https://adventofcode.com/2015/).

This is a series of puzzles that comes in a fun way to be solved. 

This time, I decided to solve all of them in Python. I don't have any prior knowledge in the language, so it will be part of the challenge to learn a new Language =)

The challenges are separated by day, until the Christmas day (25). Each of them have two parts, which are described in each solution.
There is also a page with the reference of the puzzle.

The repo is not an open project, but feel free to look at the solutions and suggest any improvement!


Tks.
